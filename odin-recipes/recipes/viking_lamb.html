        <p>
            First, insert sliced garlic into pockets.
            Cover the leg of lamb with honey and mustard.
            Salt and freshly ground pepper, I don't know if the Vikings used salt and pepper, but I do.
            Put fresh, snipped rosemary all over the lamb.

            Wrap the entire lamb well in leaves / foil
            Get Willing helpers to dig the cooking pit about a half a meter (20 inches) deep
            The hole was filled with rocks and wood, and lighted.
            The fire heated the rocks until they were glowing red, hot.
            The rocks were removed from the centre and the meat, in this case, a well leaves / foil-
            wrapped leg of lamb, placed in the center of the hole and the hot rocks were placed around the
            meat.
            This cooking pit was large enough to accommodate more than one leg of lamb.
            You can also other vegetables this way - place them further away from the rocks.

            The pit was tightly re-filled with dirt..
            About 1 hour and 15 minutes, of in-ground cooking, "bingo", the leg of lamb was baked to
            perfection, moist, delicious and ready to be served to very impressed guests
