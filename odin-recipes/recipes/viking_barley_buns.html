        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups barley flour</li>
            <li>4 cups of whole-wheat flour</li>
            <li>1-1/2 ts salt</li>
            <li>4 ts oul</li>
            <li>3-1/2 cups of boiling water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <p>
            In a heavy pan over medium-low heat, roast the barley flour in 1 T. of the oil until it smells
            good and turns several shades darker but is still off-white; flour should not turn brown. Mix
            barley and wheat flours with salt and remaining oil in a big bowl, using fingers to rub in oil,
            until it's of uniform consistency. Add the boiling water all at once and stir up quickly.
            Being careful not to scald your hands, take out a small clump of dough and work it between
            hands until it's uniform, glossy and translucent. Repeat with rest of dough, then work it all
            together into one smooth lump.
            Divide lump into into 24 smallish balls. Shape into bagels; poking a hole through the ball of
            dough works well. Arrange on oiled sheets (they won't rise much).
            Let sit overnight. (Still look just the same, don't they?) Bake in 450 oven 20 minutes, then
            reduce to 400 and cook until "done," about another 45-60 minutes. They'll have hard, dark
            brown undersides. There is a fine line between gummy-undercooked and done-but impossibly-
            hard; good luck finding it. It is recommend testing one every five minutes after they've cooked
            an hour.
            Let cool; if they're "done," they'll soften up a bit and be easier to chew. Slightly sweet and
            good with butter.
