        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <p>
            Clean the fish, wash and cut into small pieces. The slices of fish must be cooked until they are
            tender. This takes 20-30 minutes. Put the cooked fish slices on a dish and bone them. Put the
            fish back in the soup. Add the whipped cream and chopped herbs. The soup should now cook
            for about 20-30 minutes adding salt as desired. Then it is ready to be served.

            Fish soup can be served with flatbread. (A little dab of butter in the soup tastes good!)
